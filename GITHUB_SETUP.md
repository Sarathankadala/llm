# Quick GitHub Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `legal-document-simplifier` (or your choice)
   - **Description**: "AI-powered legal document simplifier web app"
   - **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT check** "Add a README file" - we already have files!
3. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creation, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/legal-document-simplifier.git
```

Copy this URL (you'll need it for the next step).

## Step 3: Tell Me Your Details

Once you've created the repository, provide me with:
- Your GitHub username: `___________`
- Your repository name: `___________`

And I'll push the code for you automatically! 🚀
